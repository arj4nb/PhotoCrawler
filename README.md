i have too many photos stored all over the place. 
From NAS directories, to local machines, etc.  Some of them are in ZIP files, some of them are in iPhoto libraries and copies of those. 
I want to make something to extract all photos, remove any duplicates or low quality thumbnails or version, and put them into a database
